# Loan-predicition
I utilized a Kaggle dataset for predicting loan term deposit subscriptions, focusing on whether individuals have already subscribed to a loan. My approach included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, label encoding, data scaling, and model implementation, culminating in making predictions.
